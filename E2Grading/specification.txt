KDLP proc module

This module will create an entry in `/proc` that holds a fixed message for all to read.

The file will show up in `/proc` as a file named `kdlp`
The fill will be owned by `root:root`
The permissions for the file will be `0444`

Operations:
	- Read:
		Reading copies data into the user buffer. The amount of data copied is the minimum between the count argument passed
		and the amount of data between the current file position and the end of the file. The value returned will be the number of bytes copied.
		The contents of the file are the string "Hello from the $STUDENT's proc entry\n"
		If the pointer passed for the buffer is invalid, EFAULT will be returned
	- Write:
		Writing is not allowed, attempting to write into the file will result in an -EPERM error.
	- Seek:
		The file position can be adjusted by seeeking. Only the seek set and seek cur operations are supported, not seek end.
		If the resulting file position would be negative or if the SEEK_END operation is attempted, -EINVAL will be returned,
		otherwise, the resulting file position is returned.
